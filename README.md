## General

### DuckFix

This feature removes duck cooldown when spamming `+duck` button.

### Map config

- Support full map name matching. i.e. `mg_test_multigames`
- Support start with any prefix. i.e. `mg_`

#### Usage

Put `***.cfg` to `csgo/cfg/lupercalia/map/` folder

This map config folder will automatically created when not exists.

#### ConVar

In default `lp_mg_mapcfg_type` is 0, which means disabled.

If you want to use exact mach i.e. `de_dust2.cfg` set `lp_mg_mapcfg_type` to 1

Or you want to use partial match i.e. `dust.cfg` set `lp_mg_mapcfg_type` to 2

---

In default `lp_mg_mapcfg_execution_timing` is 1 which means Execute on map start only.

If you want to execute at only round start set `lp_mg_mapcfg_execution_timing` to 2

Or you want to execute at both set `lp_mg_mapcfg_execution_timing` to 3


### Rocket

Probability based vertical launching system. And high chance(default) to die due to rocket accident.

Same feature as [Rocket](https://github.com/faketuna/sm-csgo-rocket)

### Easy spectate

~~Will be implemented after Trace Ray feature implemented in CounterStrikeSharp.~~ I found a way to get the player looking entity.

But another problem found. the `spec_player` command is not works as like CS:GO. it means player is actually spec a player when use `spec_player` command but player not spectate the target's POV when a freelook state.

Spectate aimed player when player is spectating/died and pressing `+use`

Same feature as [sm-CSGO-easyspectate](https://github.com/faketuna/sm-CSGO-easyspectate).
